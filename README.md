# Geochemistry_Data_Science
This is an ongoing project I originally started working on as the final project for a Pattern Classification course at UTK, using a dataset I had generated from my work at Baylor University during my masters.  I revisit this occasionally to experiment with different methods.  The data set includes 166 samples of Late Cretaceous Eagle Ford and Pepper Formations, collected from outcrops in Waco and other locations around McLennan County in central Texas.  A suite of geochemical analyses were performed on each sample including the total organic carbon (TOC), total N, 13Corg, 15N and inorganic major, and trace elements More information about this data set can be found in the original paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Boling/publication/273354575_Origin_of_organic_matter_in_the_Eagle_Ford_Formation/links/580a255408aeef1bfee3df79/Origin-of-organic-matter-in-the-Eagle-Ford-Formation.pdf)
